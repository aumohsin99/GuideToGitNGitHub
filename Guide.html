            <h1>Welcome to a basic guide for Git and GitHub</h1>
                <p>This is a basic guide on how to start using Git and GitHub for collaboration and version
                    control system.
                    These two are very important tools for the above mentioned tasks.
                </p>
            <h2>Pre-Requisites</h2>
                <p>
                    You need to have these softwares installed on your sytem before you can start using Git and GitHub.
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>VS Code</b>
                            <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">Download latest version from here</a>
                        </li>

                        <li><b>Git</b>
                            <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">Download latest version from here</a>
                        </li> 
                    </ul>

                    Apart from these softwares, you need to have an active GitHub account.
                    If you already have a GitHub account, well and good.
                    Otherwise you can create a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/signing-up-for-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account">new account using these guidelines</a>.

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>
                                GitHub Account
                            </b>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    After setting up above things, we are now ready to explore Git and GitHub.
                </p>

            <h2>Brief Introducation</h2>

                <p>Let's breifly explain about the terms we are going to explore.</p>
                <h3>Git</h3>
                <p>It is a version control system. You can manage different versions of your code using this tool. More importantly, you can create different
                    branches of code and revert to previous stable version.
                </p>
                <h3>GitHub</h3>
                <p>It is an online tool for code management. You can use this site to save your code and projects. Later on, you can retrieve
                    your project from here to your local desktop PC.
                    It provides you a number of options to collaborate with your team and organization.
                </p>
            
            <h2>Creating Repository</h2>
                <p>
                    You can create a repository on GitHub using the following steps.
                    Although there are other ways as well but I believe this is the easiest.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Open <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> and at the top right corner, click create new repository</li>
                        <img src="NRP.png" alt="Screenshot of github new repository screen">
                        <li>
                            Write the name of repository you want. Then GitHub will check if that name of repository is available or not.
                            If it is available, then you can create it. Otherwise you will get an error message.
                            Then you need to choose a differnt name.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You can choose a description for your repository. However it's optional.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You have the right to choose the privacy level for your repository in two options.
                            Either it can be public or private.
                            For this guide, we shall keep it public for easiness.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Ignore rest of the options for now and click create repository.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            An empty repository will be created in your GitHub account.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                        Enjoy ðŸ™‚
                </p>

                <h2>Time for coding</h2>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Open VS Code and create a new file.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Write some code in the file.
                            <br>
                            I have written HTML script in the file.
                        </li>
                        <img src="Basic Code.png" alt="Some HTML Code">
                        <li>
                            Save the file.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You can see the file saved in the left side of VS Code.
                        </li>


                        

                    </ul>
                </p>
